# test-protocol-header.sh — regression tests for protocol-header.sh.
# Run: bash method/test-protocol-header.sh
# No framework — just assertions against real output, same style as
# claude/hooks/test-hooks.sh and method/test-protocol-search.sh.
#
# Covers real bugs found running this script for real, not by reading it:
#   1. An f-string with a backslash inside its expression part is a
#      SyntaxError before Python 3.12 (PEP 701 lifted that restriction).
#      Every command (sync/check/emit/hook) crashed on any protocol that
#      actually contains a "### Phase N" heading.
#   2. sync() checked `text.startswith(START)` to decide whether a header
#      already existed. The project's own template — and any real protocol
#      copied from it — carries prose before the header, so the check was
#      always false there, and sync() prepended a second header on top of
#      the first instead of replacing it in place.
#   3. emit printed file-start..END instead of START..END, leaking that same
#      preamble into every hook injection.
#   4. project_name() returned the wrong regex group, so **Project:** showed
#      the generic "Scientific Protocol" title suffix instead of the actual
#      project name, for every protocol following the template's own title
#      convention.
